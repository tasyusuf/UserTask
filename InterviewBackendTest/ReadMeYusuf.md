## Hello Dear Weavr Team;

I have finished the backend task and Want to add notes here;

1-I have changed the Bearer Token for myself to get authorized.   
2-I have changed the sample assertions that you sent in sample scenario; since api v2 (/public/v2/users) have different response paths from v1 (/public/v1/users)   
3-Mainly you will find  a User Flow (create, get, update, delete , get), positive/negative test scenarios for create/update user, DDT with Csv file by using amazing Parameterized Test of Junit5 and also Builder class for update model to make our job easier against constructors.

## Note For FrontEnd Task 

***Since I have no experience on Cypress on my CV I need to make research and need time to get align with the tool. Because of the fact that I am working and I am in release week I am really busy and do not have the time to improve Cypress skills. If we move to further steps, You can definitely be sure for I will be ready with Cypress in a short time. Thank you very much***
